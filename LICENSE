GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3,29 June 2007

Copyright(c)2022 QIUZAIYOU

Copyright(C)2007 Free Software Foundation,Inc.<https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document,but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free,copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.We,the Free Software Foundation,use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software;it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.You can apply it to
your programs,too.

When we speak of free software,we are referring to freedom,not
price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software(and charge for
them if you wish),that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it,that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs,and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights,we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.Therefore,you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,or if
you modify it:responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example,if you distribute copies of such a program,whether
gratis or for a fee,you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.You must make sure that they,too,receive
or can get the source code.And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1)assert copyright on the software,and(2)offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy,distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers'and authors'protection,the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.For both users'and
authors'sake,the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed,so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them,although the manufacturer
can do so.This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users'freedom to change the software.The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use,which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.Therefore,we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.If such problems arise substantially in other domains,we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL,as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally,every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers,but in those that do,we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.To prevent this,the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying,distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0.Definitions.

"This License"refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright"also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works,such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program"refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.Each licensee is addressed as"you"."Licensees"and
"recipients"may be individuals or organizations.

To"modify"a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission,other than the making of an
exact copy.The resulting work is called a"modified version"of the
earlier work or a work"based on"the earlier work.

A"covered work"means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

To"propagate"a work means to do anything with it that,without
permission,would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law,except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.Propagation includes copying,
distribution(with or without modification),making available to the
public,and in some countries other activities as well.

To"convey"a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network,with no transfer of a copy,is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays"Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that(1)displays an appropriate copyright notice,and(2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work(except to the
extent that warranties are provided),that licensees may convey the
work under this License,and how to view a copy of this License.If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options,such as a
menu,a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1.Source Code.

The"source code"for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it."Object code"means any non-source
form of a work.

A"Standard Interface"means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body,or,in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language,one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

The"System Libraries"of an executable work include anything,other
than the work as a whole,that(a)is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component,but which is not part of that Major
Component,and(b)serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component,or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.A
"Major Component",in this context,means a major essential component
(kernel,window system,and so on)of the specific operating system
(if any)on which the executable work runs,or a compiler used to
produce the work,or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The"Corresponding Source"for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate,install,and(for an executable
work)run the object code and to modify the work,including scripts to
control those activities.However,it does not include the work's
System Libraries,or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.For example,Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work,and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

2.Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program,and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output,given its
content,constitutes a covered work.This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent,as provided by copyright law.

You may make,run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey,without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you,or provide you
with facilities for running those works,provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf,under your direction
and control,on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.Sublicensing is not allowed;section 10
makes it unnecessary.

3.Protecting Users'Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996,or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

When you convey a covered work,you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work,and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing,against the work's
users,your or third parties'legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

4.Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it,in any medium,provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5.Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program,or the modifications to
produce it from the Program,in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4,provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a)The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
it,and giving a relevant date.

b)The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
released under this License and any conditions added under section
7.This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
"keep intact all notices".

c)You must license the entire work,as a whole,under this
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.This
License will therefore apply,along with any applicable section 7
additional terms,to the whole of the work,and all its parts,
regardless of how they are packaged.This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way,but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

d)If the work has interactive user interfaces,each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices;however,if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices,your
work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works,which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,is called an
"aggregate"if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

6.Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5,provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

a)Convey the object code in,or embodied in,a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium),accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange.

b)Convey the object code in,or embodied in,a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium),accompanied by a
written offer,valid for at least three years and valid for as
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model,to give anyone who possesses the object code either(1)a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License,on a durable physical
medium customarily used for software interchange,for a price no
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
conveying of source,or(2)access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

c)Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.This
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,and
only if you received the object code with such an offer,in accord
with subsection 6b.

d)Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
place(gratis or for a charge),and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge.You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code.If the place to
copy the object code is a network server,the Corresponding Source
may be on a different server(operated by you or a third party)
that supports equivalent copying facilities,provided you maintain
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
Corresponding Source.Regardless of what server hosts the
Corresponding Source,you remain obligated to ensure that it is
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

e)Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,provided
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code,whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

A"User Product"is either(1)a"consumer product",which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,family,
or household purposes,or(2)anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.For a particular
product received by a particular user,"normally used"refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product,regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses,or expects or is expected to use,the product.A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial,industrial or non-consumer uses,unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

"Installation Information"for a User Product means any methods,
procedures,authorization keys,or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in,or with,or
specifically for use in,a User Product,and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term(regardless of how the transaction is characterized),the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product(for example,the work has
been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service,warranty,or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient,or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed,and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented(and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form),and must require no special password or key for
unpacking,reading or copying.

7.Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions"are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License,to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program,that part may be used separately
under those permissions,but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work,you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy,or from any part of
it.(Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)You may place
additional permissions on material,added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License,for material you
add to a covered work,you may(if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material)supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a)Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License;or

b)Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
Notices displayed by works containing it;or

c)Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version;or

d)Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material;or

e)Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
trade names,trademarks,or service marks;or

f)Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
material by anyone who conveys the material(or modified versions of
it)with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,for
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered"further
restrictions"within the meaning of section 10.If the Program as you
received it,or any part of it,contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction,you may remove that term.If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License,you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document,provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section,you
must place,in the relevant source files,a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files,or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms,permissive or non-permissive,may be stated in the
form of a separately written license,or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

8.Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void,and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License(including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

However,if you cease all violation of this License,then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated(a)
provisionally,unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license,and(b)permanently,if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover,your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means,this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License(for any work)from that
copyright holder,and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated,you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

9.Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.Therefore,by modifying or propagating a
covered work,you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10.Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work,the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors,to run,modify and
propagate that work,subject to this License.You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An"entity transaction"is a transaction transferring control of an
organization,or substantially all assets of one,or subdividing an
organization,or merging organizations.If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction,each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph,plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.For example,you may
not impose a license fee,royalty,or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License,and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making,using,selling,offering for
sale,or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11.Patents.

A"contributor"is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's"contributor version".

A contributor's"essential patent claims"are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor,whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired,that would be infringed by some manner,permitted
by this License,of making,using,or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.For
purposes of this definition,"control"includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive,worldwide,royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims,to
make,use,sell,offer for sale,import and otherwise run,modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs,a"patent license"is any express
agreement or commitment,however denominated,not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).To"grant"such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work,knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy,free of charge and under the terms of this License,through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either(1)cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available,or(2)arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work,or(3)arrange,in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License,to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients."Knowingly relying"means you have
actual knowledge that,but for the patent license,your conveying the
covered work in a country,or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country,would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If,pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement,you convey,or propagate by procuring conveyance of,a
covered work,and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,propagate,modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work,then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

A patent license is"discriminatory"if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage,prohibits the exercise of,or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software,under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work,and under which the third party grants,to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you,a discriminatory
patent license(a)in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you(or copies made from those copies),or(b)primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work,unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted,prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12.No Surrender of Others'Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you(whether by court order,agreement or
otherwise)that contradict the conditions of this License,they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations,then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.For example,if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program,the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13.Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License,you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work,and to convey the resulting work.The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13,concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

14.Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License"or any later version"applies to it,you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License,you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used,that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.However,no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

15.Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM,TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM"AS IS"WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND,EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,INCLUDING,BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16.Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL,SPECIAL,INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

17.Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program,unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program,and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public,the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so,attach the following notices to the program.It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty;and each file should have at least
the"copyright"line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright(C)<year><name of author>

This program is free software:you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation,either version 3 of the License,or
(at your option)any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program.If not,see<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction,make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

<program>Copyright(C)<year><name of author>
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;for details type`show w'.
This is free software,and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions;type`show c'for details.

The hypothetical commands`show w'and`show c'should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.Of course,your program's commands
might be different;for a GUI interface,you would use an"about box".

You should also get your employer(if you work as a programmer)or school,
if any,to sign a"copyright disclaimer"for the program,if necessary.
For more information on this,and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL,see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.If your program is a subroutine library,you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.If this is what you want to do,use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.But first,please read
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.

同时，为了保护作者与我们（按：指自由软件基金会），我们想要确定每个人都明白，自由软件是沒有担保责任的。如果软件被他人修改并加以传播，我们需要其收受者知道，他们所得到的并非原始版本，因此由他人所引出的任何问题对原作者的声誉将不会有任何的影响。

最后，所有自由软件不断地受到软件专利的威胁。我们希望能避免自由软件的再发布者以个人名义取得专利授权而使程序专有化的风险。为了防止上述的情事发生，我们在此明确声明：任何专利都必须为了每个人的自由使用而核准，否则就不应授与专利。

以下是有关复制、发布及修改的明确条款及条件。

复制、发布与修改的条款与条件

0. 凡著作权人在其程序或其他著作中声明，该程序或著作会在通用公共授权条款下发布，本授权对其均有适用。以下所称的"程序"，是指任何一种适用通用公共授权的程序或著作；并且一个"基于本程序的著作"，则指本程序或任何基于著作权法所产生的衍生著作，换言之，是指包含本程序全部或一部的著作，不论是完整的或经过修改的程序，以及（或）翻译成其他语言的程序（以下"修改"一词包括但不限于翻译行为在內）。被授权人则称为"您"。
本授权不适用于复制、发布与修改以外的行为；这些行为不在本授权范围内。执行本程序的行为并不受限制，而本程序的输出只有在其內容构成基于本程序所生的著作（而非只是因为执行本程序所造成）时，始受本授权拘束。至于程序的输出內容是否构成本程序的衍生著作，则取决于本程序的具体用途。

1. 您可以对所收受的本程序源代码，无论以何种媒介，复制与发布其完整的复制物，然而您必须符合以下要件：以显著及适当的方式在每一份复制物上发布适当的著作权标示及无担保声明；维持所有有关本授权以及无担保声明的原貌；并将本授权的副本连同本程序一起交付予其他任何一位本程序的收受者。
您可以对让与复制物的实际行为收取一定的费用，您也可以自由决定是否提供担保以作为对价的交换。

2. 您可以修改本程序的一个或数个复制物或者本程序的任何部份，以此形成基于本程序所生的著作，并依前述第一条规定，复制与发布此一修改过的程序或著作，但您必须符合以下要件：
(a) 您必须在所修改的挡案上附加显著的标示，阐明您修改过这些挡案，以及修改日期。
(b) 您必须就您所发布或发行的著作，无论是包含本程序全部或一部的著作，或者是自本程序或其任何部份所衍生的著作，整体授权所有第三人依本授权规定使用，且不得因此项授权行为而收取任何费用。
(c) 若经过修改的程序在执行时通常以交互方式读取命令时，您必须在最常被使用的方式下，于开始进入这种交互式使用时，列印或展示以下宣告：适当的著作权标示及无担保声明（或者声明您提供担保）、使用者可以依这些条件再发布此程序，以及告知使用者如何浏览本授权的副本。（例外：若本程序本身是以交互的方式执行，然而通常却不会列印该宣告时，则您基于本程序所生的著作便无需列印该宣告。）
这些要求对修改过的著作是整体适用的。倘著作中可识別的一部份并非衍生自本程序，并且可以合理地认为是一独立的、个別的著作，则当您将其作为个別著作加以发布时，本授权及其条款将不适用于该部分。然而当您将上述部分，作为基于本程序所生著作的一部而发布时，整个著作的发布必须符合本授权条款的规定，而本授权对于其他被授权人所为的许可及于著作整体。
因此，本条规定的意图不在于主张或剥夺您对于完全由您所完成著作的权利；应该說，本条规定意在行使对基于程序所生的之衍生著作或集合著作发布行为的控制权。
此外，非基于本程序所生的其他著作与本程序（或基于本程序所生的著作）在同一储存或发布的媒介上的单纯聚集行为，并不会使该著作因此受本授权条款约束。

3. 您可以依前述第一、二条规定，复制与发布本程序（或第二条所述基于本程序所产生的著作）的目的码或可执行形式，但您必须符合以下要件：
(a) 附上完整、相对应的机器可判读源码，而这些源码必须依前述第一、二条规定在经常用以作为软件交换的媒介物上发布；或
(b) 附上至少三年有效的书面报价文件，提供任何第三人在支付不超过实际发布源码所需成本的费用下，取得相同源码的完整机器可读复制物，并依前述第一、二条规定在经常用以作为软件交换的媒介物上发布该复制物；或
(c) 附上您所收受有关发布相同源码的报价资讯。（本项选择仅在非赢利发布、且仅在您依前述b项方式自该书面报价文件收受程序目的码或可执行形式时，始有适用。）
著作的源码，是指对著作进行修改时适用的形式。对于一个可执行的著作而言，完整的源码是指著作中所包含所有模组的全部源码，加上相关介面的定义挡，还加上用以控制该著作编译与安裝的描述。然而，特別的例外情况是，所发布的源码并不需包含任何通常会随著所执行作业系统的主要组成部分（编译器、核心等等）而发布的软件（无论以源码或二进位格式），除非该部分本身即附加在可执行程序中。
若可执行码或目的码的发布方式，是以指定的地点提供存取位置供人复制，则提供可自相同地点复制源码的使用机会，视同对于源码的发布，然而第三人并不因此而负有将目的码连同源码一起复制的义务。

4. 除本授权所明示的方式外，您不得对本程序加以复制、修改、再授权或发布。任何试图以其他方式进行复制、修改、再授权或者发布本程序的行为均为无效，并且将自动终止您基于本授权所得享有的权利。然而，依本授权规定自您手中收受复制物或权利之人，只要遵守本授权规定，他们所获得的授权并不会因此终止。

5. 因为您并未在本授权上签名，所以您无须接受本授权。然而，除此之外您別无其他修改或发布本程序或其衍生著作的授权许可。若您不接受本授权，则这些行为在法律上都是被禁止的。因此，藉由对本程序（或任何基于本程序所生的著作）的修改或发布行为，您表示了对于本授权的接受，以及接受所有关于复制、发布或修改本程序或基于本程序所生著作的条款与条件。

6. 每当您再发布本程序（或任何基于本程序所生的著作）时，收受者即自动获得原授权人所授予依本授权条款与条件复制、发布或修改本程序的权利。您不得就本授权所赋予收受者行使的权利附加任何进一步的限制。您对于第三人是否履行本授权一事，无须负责。

7. 若法院判决、专利侵权主张或者其他任何理由（不限于专利争议）的结果，使得加诸于您的条件（无论是由法院命令、协议书或其他方式造成）与本授权规定有所冲突，他们并不免除您对于本授权规定的遵守。若您无法同时符合依本授权所生义务及其他相关义务而进行发布，那么其结果便是您不得发布该程序。例如，若专利授权不允许其他人直接或间接取得复制物，通过您以免付权利金的方式再发布该程序，您唯一能同时滿足该义务及本授权的方式就是徹底避免进行该程序的发布。
若本条任一部份在特殊情况下被认定无效或无法执行时，本条其余部分仍应适用，且本条全部于其他情况下仍应适用。
本条的目的并不在诱使您侵害专利或其他財产权的权利主张，或就此类主张的有效性加以争执；本条的唯一目的，是在保障藉由公共授权惯例所执行自由软件发布系统的完整性。许多人信赖该系统一贯使用的应用程序，而对经由此系统发布的大量软件有相当多的贡献；作者／贡献者有权决定他或她是否希望经由其他的系统发布软件，而被授权人则无该种选择权。
本条的用意在于将本授权其他不确定的部分徹底解释清楚。

8. 若因为专利或享有著作权保护的介面问题，而使得本程序的发布与／或使用局限于某些国家时，则将本程序置于本授权规范之下的原著作权人得增列明确的发布地区限制条款，将这些国家排除在外，而使发布的许可只限在未受排除的国家之內或之中。在该等情况下，该限制条款如同以书面方式订定于本授权內容中，而成为本授权的条款。

9. 自由软件基金会得随时发表通用公共授权的修正版与／或新版本。新版本在精神上将近似于目前的版本，然而在细节上或所不同以因应新的问题或状况。
每一个版本都有个別的版本号码。若本程序指定有授权版本号码，表示其适用该版本或是"任何新版本"时，您可以选择遵循该版本或任何由自由软件基金会日后所发表新版本的条款与条件。若本程序并未指定授权版本号码时，您可以选择任一自由软件基金会所发表的版本。

10. 若您想将部分本程序纳入其他自由程序，而其发布的条件有所不同时，请写信取得作者的许可。若为自由软件基金会享有著作权的软件，请写信至自由软件基金会；我们有时会以例外方式予以处理。我们的决定取决于两项目标：确保我们自由软件的所有衍生著作均维持在自由的状态，并广泛地促进软件的分享与再利用。

无担保声明

11. 由于本程序是无偿授权，因此在法律许可范围內，本授权对本程序并不负担保责任。非经书面声明，著作权人与／或其他提供程序之人，无论明示或默许，均是依「现况」提供本程序而并无任何形式的担保责任，其包括但不限于，就适售性以及特定目的的适用性为默示性担保。有关本程序品质与效能的全部风险均由您承担。如本程序被证明有瑕疵，您应承担所有服务、修复或改正的费用。

12. 非经法律要求或书面同意，任何著作权人或任何可能依前述方式修改与／或发布本程序者，对于您因为使用或不能使用本程序所造成的一般性、特殊性、意外性或间接性损失，不负任何责任（包括但不限于，资料损失，资料执行不精确，或应由您或第三人承担的损失，或本程序无法与其他程序运作等），即便前述的著作权人或其他人已被告知该等损失的可能性时，也是一样。

-条文结束-

您的新程序该如何采用这些条款？

如果您开发了一个新程序，并且希望能够让它尽可能地被大众使用，达成此目的的最好方式就是让它成为自由软件，任何人依这些条款规定都能就该软件再为发布及修改。

为了做到这一点，请将以下声明附加到程序上。最安全的作法，是将声明放在每份源码挡案的起始处，以有效传达无担保责任的讯息；且每份挡案至少应有「著作权」列以及本份声明全文位置的提示。

用一行描述程序的名称与其用途简述

著作权所有(C) 〈年份〉〈作者姓名〉

本程序为自由软件；您可依据自由软件基金会所发表的GNU通用公共授权条款规定，就本程序再为发布与／或修改；无论您依据的是本授权的第二版或（您自行选择的）任一日后发行的版本。

本程序是基于使用目的而加以发布，然而不负任何担保责任；亦无对适售性或特定目的适用性所为的默示性担保。详情请参照GNU通用公共授权。

您应已收到附随于本程序的GNU通用公共授权的副本；如果没有，请写信至自由软件基金会：59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, Ma 02111-1307, USA。

同时附上如何以电子及书面信件与您联系的资料。

若程序是以交互方式运作时，请在交互式模式开始时，输出简短提示如下：
Gnomovision 第69版，著作权所有 (c) 年份 作者姓名

Gnomovision不负担保责任，欲知详情请键入'show w'。这是一个自由软件，欢迎您在特定条件下再发布本程序；欲知详情请键入'show c'。 

所假设的指令'show w'与'show c'应显示通用公共授权的相对应条款。当然，您可以使用'show w'与'show c'以外的指令名称；甚至以鼠标键击或选菜单方式进行-只要是合于您程序需要的方式都可以。

如有需要，您亦应取得您的雇主（若您的工作为程序设计師）或学校就本程序所签署的「著作权放弃承諾书」。其范例如下，您只要修改姓名即可：

Yoyodyne公司，茲此放弃James Hacker所写之'Gnomovision'程序（该程序产出编译器所需资讯）所有的著作权利益。

〈Ty Coon公司签章〉，1989年四月一日

Ty Coon公司,副总裁

本通用公共授权并不允许您将本程序并入专有程序中。若您的程序是一子程序函数库时，您可能认为允许专有应用程序与该函式库相连结会更有帮助。若这是您所想做的，请使用GNU函式库通用公共授权代替本授权。
